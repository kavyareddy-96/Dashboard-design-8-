This project is a sales performance dashboard created using Power BI as part of Task 8 for the Data Analyst Internship. The main objective was to design a simple yet insightful dashboard that allows users to visualize and analyze sales performance based on product categories, regions, and time. The dataset used for this project was the Superstore_Sales.csv file, which includes key attributes such as Order Date, Region, Category, Sales, Profit, and Quantity.
The dashboard highlights key performance indicators (KPIs) such as the total sales of 14.18M, total profit of 2.14M, and the total quantity sold at 55K units. To better understand sales trends, the dashboard includes a line chart showing the sum of sales over time (by order date), a bar chart breaking down sales by region, and a donut chart representing the distribution of profit across categories and regions. Additionally, a combined bar chart displays the relationship between quantity and sales for different product names.
The dashboard is interactive and provides visual clarity through consistent formatting and color-coding, helping users quickly identify high-performing regions and product categories. For example, sales are relatively well-distributed across all four regions, while the Technology category stands out in terms of profitability. The use of slicers or filters can further help users narrow down insights by specific regions or product categories.
This project demonstrates the ability to clean and prepare data, select appropriate visualizations, and build a user-friendly dashboard that effectively communicates business insights.
